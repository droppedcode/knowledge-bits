# Generators

[The Power of JS Generators by Anjana Vakil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu3FfmgkwUc)

Little bit too excited presenter, but good collection of generator use cases and features.

# Meta programming

[JavaScript Metaprogramming - Dave Fancher - NDC London 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo0ukBw4nZE)

NOt the best presenter, but very deep collection of the meta programming (code manipulation) features of js.
